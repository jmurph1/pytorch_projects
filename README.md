# pytorch_projects
This repo contains some highlights from some projects I've worked on while learning ML independently. Particularly, they are coming from my attempts at Unsloth AI's puzzle challenges [released in Feb. '25]; I plateaued around 14-15 points out of 18 needed to satisfy the first stage, as I sunk a lot of time in the FSDP challenge, which ended up being very hard although it was suggested as a potential medium-level puzzle. (I stopped when I realized that HuggingFace engineers had started trying to implement it and seemed far off.... plus apparently Unsloth is still working on it, c.a. July '25 -- whereas when I was trying it I'd only been learning ML for about 3 months LoL.) 

I've selected out a couple of (hopefully) production ready items to live here in this repo, while below are links to the two notebooks I was mainly working out of -- (fair warning that I haven't cleaned up these notebooks at all!)
